    <img src="Images++/atom.png" alt="Atom Program">
    <p>Atom is a free and open-source text and source code editor for macOS, Linux, and Microsoft Windows with support for plug-ins written in Node.js,
      and embedded Git Control, developed by GitHub. Atom is a desktop application built using web technologies.Most of the extending packages have free
      software licenses and are community-built and maintained.Atom is based on Electron (formerly known as Atom Shell),a framework that enables cross-
      platform desktop applications using Chromium and Node.js. It is written in CoffeeScript and Less.Atom was released from beta, as version 1.0, on
      25 June 2015.Its developers call it a "hackable text editor for the 21st Century".It is fully customizable in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

    <h2>Arduino.exe</h2>
    <img src="Images++/arduino.png" alt="Arduino Program">
    <p>The Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a cross-platform application (for Windows, macOS, Linux) that is written in functions from C
      and C++. It is used to write and upload programs to Arduino compatible boards, but also, with the help of 3rd party cores, other vendor development
      boards.The source code for the IDE is released under the GNU General Public License, version 2.The Arduino IDE supports the languages C and C++ using
      special rules of code structuring.The Arduino IDE supplies a software library from the Wiring project, which provides many common input and output
      procedures.User-written code only requires two basic functions, for starting the sketch and the main program loop, that are compiled and linked with
      a program stub main() into an executable cyclic executive program with the GNU toolchain, also included with the IDE distribution.The Arduino IDE
      employs the program avrdude to convert the executable code into a text file in hexadecimal encoding that is loaded into the Arduino board by a loader
      program in the board's firmware.By default, avrdude is used as the uploading tool to flash the user code onto official Arduino boards.With the rising
      popularity of Arduino as a software platform, other vendors started to implement custom open source compilers & tools (cores) that can build and upload
      sketches to other MCUs that are not supported by Arduino's official line of MCUs.In October 2019 the Arduino organization began providing early access
      to a new Arduino Pro IDE with debugging and other advanced features. </p>

    <h2>CodePen</h2>
    <img src="Images++/codepen.png" alt="CodePen Site">
    <p>CodePen is an online community for testing and showcasing user-created HTML, CSS and JavaScript code snippets. It functions as an online code editor and open-source
      learning environment, where developers can create code snippets, called "pens," and test them. It was founded in 2012 by full-stack developers Alex Vazquez and Tim Sabat
      and front-end designer Chris Coyier.Its employees work remotely, rarely all meeting together in person. CodePen is one of the largest communities for web designers and
      developers to showcase their coding skills,with an estimated 330,000 registered users and 14.16 million monthly visitors.</p>

    <h2>NetBeans</h2>
    <img src="Images++/netbeans.png" alt="NetBeans Program">
    <p>NetBeans is an integrated development environment (IDE) for Java. NetBeans allows applications to be developed from a set of modular software components
      called modules. NetBeans runs on Windows, macOS, Linux and Solaris. In addition to Java development, it has extensions for other languages like PHP, C, C++,
      HTML5,and JavaScript. Applications based on NetBeans, including the NetBeans IDE, can be extended by third party developers.NetBeans began in 1996 as Xelfi
      (word play on Delphi),a Java IDE student project under the guidance of the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics at Charles University in Prague. In 1997, Roman
      Staněk formed a company around the project and produced commercial versions of the NetBeans IDE until it was bought by Sun Microsystems in 1999. Sun open-sourced
      the NetBeans IDE in June of the following year. Since then, the NetBeans community has continued to grow.In 2010, Sun (and thus NetBeans) was acquired by Oracle
      Corporation. Under Oracle, NetBeans competed with JDeveloper, a freeware IDE that has historically been a product of the company. In September 2016, Oracle submitted
      a proposal to donate the NetBeans project to the Apache Software Foundation, stating that it was "opening up the NetBeans governance model to give NetBeans constituents
      a greater voice in the project's direction and future success through the upcoming release of Java 9 and NetBeans 9 and beyond". The move was endorsed by Java
      creator James Gosling.The project entered the Apache Incubator in October 2016.</p>
